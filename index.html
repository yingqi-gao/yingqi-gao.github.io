        <h2>Research</h2>
        <div class="curly-divider"></div>
        <p>
          My research explores the <b>two-way interaction between AI and economic systems</b>, 
          focusing on (1) how AI can improve economic decision-making and 
          (2) how economic principles can shape AI-driven markets. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As digital assets like data, privacy, and AI-generated content become more valuable, 
          traditional markets must adapt. I develop mechanisms that enable efficient trade while ensuring fairness, 
          privacy, and strategic incentives. Currently, I am designing <b>fair yet profitable data marketplaces</b>, 
          ensuring efficient trading mechanisms while aligning incentives for buyers and sellers. 
          Looking ahead, I aim to develop <b>a privacy market</b> where users can dynamically control their 
          data exposure‚Äîlike turning a knob‚Äîbalancing privacy protection with economic incentives. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I study how <b>AI can integrate economic reasoning to make better decisions
          under uncertainty</b>.
          For example, retrieval-based AI can improve predictive reliability by drawing on external knowledge. 
          In <b>healthcare</b>, this could mean retrieving past diagnoses made by human professionals 
          from similar cases to assess uncertainty in a new diagnosis, ensuring AI-generated recommendations 
          are not only data-driven but also grounded in real-world medical expertise. 
          Similarly, in <b>AI-powered chatbots</b>, this goes beyond simply listing the sources
          ‚Äîit involves statistically interpreting those sources to quantify the credibility of an answer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A related concept has been explored in <b>ads auctions</b>, 
          where large language models incorporate bidding mechanisms to optimize AI-generated ad placement. 
          I aim to expand this idea by <b>introducing an economic interpretation of AI-generated value</b>, 
          ensuring that outcomes align with market incentives. For instance, if someone bids $100, 
          the AI-generated ad should deliver at least proportionally greater value compared to a $10 bid. 
          Embedding this principle enhances fairness, reinforces incentives, and strengthens trust in AI-driven markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I seek to build <b>scalable, inference-driven AI systems</b> that go 
          beyond processing information to <b>actively reason, adapt, and make economically sound decisions</b>
          in complex marketplaces shaped by human behavior and strategic interactions.
          By integrating <b>statistical reasoning to assess uncertainty</b> and 
          <b>economic principles to ensure fairness and incentives</b>, 
          my work seeks to create AI-driven markets that are both <b>efficient and trustworthy</b>. 
          From (1) data markets to (2) privacy trading, 
          where users control their exposure instead of passively surrendering data,
          to (3) LLM-powered ads auctions and (4) retrieval-based decision-making, 
          I strive to build systems that bridge AI intelligence with economic insight, 
          fostering <b>transparent, adaptable, and value-aligned AI interactions</b>.
