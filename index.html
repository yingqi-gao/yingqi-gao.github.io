            Hi, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the

        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            My research explores the <b>two-way interaction between AI and economic systems</b>, 
            focusing on (1) how AI can improve economic decision-making and 
            (2) how economic principles can shape AI-driven markets. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As digital assets like data, privacy, and AI-generated content become more valuable, 
            traditional markets must adapt. I develop mechanisms that enable efficient trade while ensuring fairness, 
            privacy, and strategic incentives. Currently, I am designing <b>fair yet profitable data marketplaces</b>, 
            ensuring efficient trading mechanisms while aligning incentives for buyers and sellers. 
            Looking ahead, I aim to develop <b>a privacy market</b> where users can dynamically control their 
            data exposure—like turning a knob—balancing privacy protection with economic incentives. 
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I study how <b>AI can integrate economic reasoning to make better decisions
            under uncertainty</b>.
            For example, retrieval-based AI can improve predictive reliability by drawing on external knowledge. 
            In <b>healthcare</b>, this could mean retrieving past diagnoses made by human professionals 
            from similar cases to assess uncertainty in a new diagnosis, ensuring AI-generated recommendations 
            are not only data-driven but also grounded in real-world medical expertise. 
            Similarly, in <b>AI-powered chatbots</b>, this goes beyond simply listing the sources
            —it involves statistically interpreting those sources to quantify the credibility of an answer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A related concept has been explored in <b>ads auctions</b>, 
            where large language models incorporate bidding mechanisms to optimize AI-generated ad placement. 
            I aim to expand this idea by <b>introducing an economic interpretation of AI-generated value</b>, 
            ensuring that outcomes align with market incentives. For instance, if someone bids $100, 
            the AI-generated ad should deliver at least proportionally greater value compared to a $10 bid. 
            Embedding this principle enhances fairness, reinforces incentives, and strengthens trust in AI-driven markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I seek to build <b>scalable, inference-driven AI systems</b> that go 
            beyond processing information to <b>actively reason, adapt, and make economically sound decisions</b>
            in complex marketplaces shaped by human behavior and strategic interactions.
            By integrating <b>statistical reasoning to assess uncertainty</b> and 
            <b>economic principles to ensure fairness and incentives</b>, 
            my work seeks to create AI-driven markets that are both <b>efficient and trustworthy</b>. 
            From (1) data markets to (2) privacy trading, 
            where users control their exposure instead of passively surrendering data,
            to (3) LLM-powered ads auctions and (4) retrieval-based decision-making, 
            I strive to build systems that bridge AI intelligence with economic insight, 
            fostering <b>transparent, adaptable, and value-aligned AI interactions</b>.

              She is a talented and knowledgeable professional who made the class manageable and always checked in with students. 
              Her discussions were on-point, and she was willing to meet with students after class to address difficulties. 
              You can truly see when someone cares about their profession—Yingqi embodies that and so much more.”

              “Ms. Gao is an excellent TA, and I greatly appreciate her. 
              Without her, I would have struggled with the class and missed out on valuable training 
              in statistical methods for real-world problems. 
              Before the class, I was terrified of analyzing large datasets—now, I feel competent and inspired. 
              I’m even considering a minor in statistics because of her. She deserves every raise available to TAs.”
