        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Hi, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/" class="link">Department of Statistics & Data Science</a> 
            at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" class="link">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>. 
            I am a member of the <a href="https://www.xiaowudai.org/group" class="link">Lab for Statistics, Computing, Algorithms, Learning, and Economics (SCALE)</a>, 
            advised by <a href="https://www.xiaowudai.org/" class="link">Prof. Xiaowu Dai</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to my Ph.D., I earned two Bachelor of Science degrees in Probability & Statistics and Management Science at 
            <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" class="link">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</a>, 
            as well as a Master of Arts in Statistics at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" class="link">Columbia University</a>, 
            where I was advised by <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/webpages/msobel/" class="link">Prof. Michael E. Sobel</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My research interests are in the <b>interdisciplinarity of Machine Learning and Economics</b>. 
            I am currently focused on refining and developing mechanisms tailored to the economy of machine learning-related products, such as data pricing and trading. 
            I am also passionate about the opposite direction, which is to integrate economic concepts into machine learning model design.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My first name is pronounced as <i>yuhng-chee</i>.

            <li>
              "TA had a really good understanding of the material and could answer any question extremely well 
              and was in general very helpful."
            </li>
            <li>
              "I only have a year in UCLA and I can say without a doubt that Yingqi, by far, 
              has been the best TA I have had! 
              Coming into this course, I was nervous about the workload since there is a lot to cover in so little time 
              but Yingqi is a very talented and knowledgeable professional and has made it so much easier. 
              She has made this class very manageable, not to mention how on-point her discussions are, 
              as well as the time she takes to pause and asks us for any questions we may have and 
              she is also willing to meet with students after discussion to resolve any conflicts we may have encountered. 
              You can truly see when someone cares about their profession, Yingqi emobies that and so much more. 
              I am really grateful to have had a TA such as Yingqi."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Ms. Gao is an excellent TA and I greatly appreciate her. Without her I would not only struggle with the class, 
              but I would have lost out on valuable training of statistical methods for real-world problems. 
              Before the class, I was terrified at the thought of doing statistical and computational analysis of huge data sets. 
              Now I feel extremely competent and inspired to learn more about these methods on my own. 
              I'm even considering a minor in statistics because of Ms. Gao. 
              I appreciate her so much and she deserves every raise available to TA's."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Yingqi was exceptional in her explanation of concepts and was clear and succinct in her instruction of 
              the course material. She often went out of her way to connect concepts from the main lecture back into 
              the lab section, which I found very helpful in understanding the lab material. 
              She was also very helpful in providing resources after the lab section was over to complete the lab assignments."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Yingqi is a FANTASTIC programming/ stats TA. 
              She's so sweet and considerate towards her cohort, accommodating us with various resources, recordings, 
              and extra after-class support. 
              She's also an amazing teacher who was amazing at simplifying complex concepts. 
              I would have absolutely despised the programming component of this class had I not been in Yingqi's section!"
            </li>
            <li>
              "Yingqi was very kind and passionate about the material. Whenever I asked questions she would not only give me a response, 
              but helped me understand why the code was written in a specific way over the other. 
              Even if there were only a few of us who attended section, she was very inviting and tried to get to know us better."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Yingqi is very approachable, which makes me feel supported and unafraid to ask questions. 
              She possesses a great amount of knowledge about the course material, and she explains it in a way 
              that does not further complicate the class material. 
              In addition, she ensures clear communication with us students, announcing things that we need to know ahead of time. 
              Overall, Yingqi's clear explanations and communication skills have been a great asset to our class.""

              "This TA was sweet and helpful. I did join the course a week late and she made sure I felt on track. 
              If anything was left unclear she always made sure to clear things out I really really appreciate that. 
              This TA always shared new knowledge with us and we always left learning something new."

              "This TA was so kind and helpful at all times. Even though she obviously had a busy personal life, 
              she always made time for the class and made recordings whenever there wasn't section to help us on the labs. 
              It was such a joy to be in her discussion. Her pace was very fast, but it was necessary to get through all the content, 
              and she was always responsive to emails and was willing to meet outside of section and her office hours if needed. 
              She never gave up on me if I had an issue, even if it was complicated. 
              She was a bright energy in section which I think created a comforting environment for a subject 
              that I was really worried I would struggle with."

              "Yingqi was a great and well rounded TA. She really went above and beyond when it came to supporting us in doing labs. 
              She is clearly very knowledgeable and is quick to address any concerns that I might have regarding R or material covered in lecture. 
              I have nothing but praise for her as a TA. She was awesome and I would definitely take her section again if given the chance!"
