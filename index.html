            Hi, I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the 
            <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/" class="link">Department of Statistics & Data Science</a> 
            at the <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" class="link">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>. 
            I am a member of the

            <a href="https://www.xiaowudai.org/" class="link">Prof. Xiaowu Dai</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to my Ph.D., I earned dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Probability & Statistics and Management Science 
            from the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" class="link">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</a>, 
            and a Master of Arts in Statistics from

            My research lies at the intersection of <b>Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and Economics</b>. In particular,
          </p>
          <p>
            (1) <b>Market-driven mechanisms</b> that enable intelligent decision-making and efficient resources allocation 
            in <b>AI markets</b>, which coordinate the pricing, exchange, and utilization of 
            <b>data, ML models, and APIs (such as LLM services)</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) <b>Next-generation AI systems</b> where autonomous <b>agents</b> learn and reason 
            through causal and economic principles to achieve <b>stable, adaptive, and intelligent</b> collective behavior.
            Ensure efficient operations in environments shaped heavily by human behavior and strategic interactions.

            My research explores the <b>two-way interaction between AI and economic systems</b>, 
            studying how AI can enhance economic decision-making and 
            how economic principles can guide the design of intelligent, adaptive AI systems.

              <span class="research-highlight">Learning-Based Mechanisms for AI Economies</span>
              As digital assets—such as <b>data, privacy, APIs, and AI-generated content</b>—gain economic significance,
              markets must learn to price, trade, and utilzie them smartly and efficiently. 
              I design <b>profit-aware, data-efficient, incentive-aligned mechanisms</b>, such as<br>
              <span class="research-highlight">(1) AI-driven digital marketplaces</span> 
              that learn buyer values over time and attain optimal revenue faster, and<br> 
              <span class="research-highlight">(2) Incentive-aligned privacy markets</span> 
              where users, instead of being forced to surrender their privacy, 
              can decide to whom and to what extent to share their data in exchange for economic rewards.

            <p>
              <span class="research-highlight">AI Systems with Economic and Statistical Reasoning</span>
              I study how <b>AI systems can integrate causal and economic reasoning</b> 
              to make interpretable, uncertainty-aware decisions, including
              <span class="research-highlight">(1) Prediction-powered uncertainty quantification</span> 
              that leverages foundation models to construct prediction intervals using inexpensive model-generated data, 
              reducing reliance on costly real-world observations, and<br> 
              <span class="research-highlight">(2) Retrieval-augmented LLMs</span> 
              that not only retrieve relevant information but also reveal how responses are generated, 
              identify which resources to rely on, and rank results by their reliability.<br> 
              By embedding statistical inference within adaptive learning,
              my work enables <b>AI systems that quantify uncertainty and act strategically</b> 
              under limited or evolving information.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="research-focus">
            <p>
              <span class="research-highlight">Economic Alignment in Generative and Agentic AI</span>
              I explore how <b>large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems</b> 
              can interact through <b>economic incentives</b> to align behavior and value creation. 
              Building on insights from <b>auction and market design</b>, 
              I investigate mechanisms that link bids, rewards, and generated outcomes—ensuring
              that AI-generated content or actions reflect proportional economic value. 
              This economic interpretation strengthens fairness, trust, and transparency
              in AI-driven environments such as <b>recommendation and advertising systems</b>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Ultimately, I aim to build <b>economically intelligent, inference-driven AI systems</b> 
            that not only learn from data but also <b>reason, adapt, and coordinate through incentives</b>. 
            By integrating <b>causal inference</b> for uncertainty quantification and 
            <b>mechanism design principles</b> for incentive alignment, 
            my research bridges machine learning and economics to create <b>scalable, value-aligned AI ecosystems</b>.

              “Yingqi has been the best TA I have had at UCLA. 
              She is a talented and knowledgeable professional who made the class manageable and always checked in with students. 
              Her discussions were on-point, and she was willing to meet with students after class to address difficulties. 
              You can truly see when someone cares about their profession—Yingqi embodies that and so much more.”

              “Ms. Gao is an excellent TA, and I greatly appreciate her. 
              Without her, I would have struggled with the class and missed out on valuable training 
              in statistical methods for real-world problems. 
              Before the class, I was terrified of analyzing large datasets—now, I feel competent and inspired. 
              I’m even considering a minor in statistics because of her. She deserves every raise available to TAs.”

                She was always considerate, providing extra resources, recordings, and after-class support. 
                Her ability to simplify complex concepts made a huge difference.
